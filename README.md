# Hello!

You came to see the project very fast, faster than I could update this repository.

This code that is here is just the first attempt and I will refine and improve by
the weekend.

I deployed this website on a vercel server. You can access [here](https://test-website-rho-three.vercel.app/)

# Design

If you access the link above you'll see that it's a mobile version of the layout 
below. This happened because in the middle of the development I understood the
concept of "Mobile First". I'm using Figma.
